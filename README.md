You can open the PNG files with https://app.diagrams.net/ to search for courses using text with CTRL-F. Images compressed cannot be opened this way. This often happens when an image is sent over 3rd party platforms. You can download a new, uncompressed version here and it should fix the issue.  
  
Colorless versions are available to plan out semesters, pathways, etc. by coloring classes in yourself with the site above.  
  
.drawio files are also available for those who want them.  
  
Data sources, in order of precedence: Courses@Brown, cs.brown.edu, course websites, The Critical Review.
