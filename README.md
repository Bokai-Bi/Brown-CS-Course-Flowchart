It is recommended to download the .drawio file and open it in websites such as https://app.diagrams.net/ so you can search courses with CTRL-F, but a png file is also available.  
Data sources, in order of precedence: Courses@Brown, cs.brown.edu, course websites, The Critical Review.  
Please tell me in issues if there're any problems or if you have suggestions to increase readability. You can also contact me on Discord at KoishiHat#0044
