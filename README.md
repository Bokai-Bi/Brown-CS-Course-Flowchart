[.drawio version for searching](https://github.com/Bokai-Bi/Brown-CS-Course-Flowchart/blob/main/Brown%20CS%20Course%20Flowchart%20v1.01.drawio)  
[colorless .drawio version for planning](https://github.com/Bokai-Bi/Brown-CS-Course-Flowchart/blob/main/Brown%20CS%20Course%20Flowchart%20v1.01%20CL.drawio)  

It is recommended to download the .drawio file and open it in websites such as https://app.diagrams.net/ so you can search courses with CTRL-F, but a png picture file is also available. You can also use the colorless .drawio version to plan out semesters, pathways, etc. by coloring them in yourself.
